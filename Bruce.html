            Home: Great Barrier Reef<br>
            Great White Sharks are generally found in cool, coastal waters.
            The Female members of the species are generally larger then the males
            and are able to grow to 21 feet. On average these sharks are 15 feet long. 
            Their grey upper boddies help them blend in with the rocky coastal sea floor. They 
            are carnivorous predators with great senses of smell, and can even detect Electromagnetic fields generated by other
            animals.They are a vulnerable species with overfishing being a leading cause
            of premature death.
